# noise-quality-measure
Python version of nqm algorithm implementation

Here is a python program translated from matlab code(https://github.com/sattarab/image-quality-tools/blob/master/metrix_mux/metrix/nqm/ImageQuality/nqm_modified.m).

I guarantee that the error between the results of this python code and the matlab code is less than 0.000123456.
